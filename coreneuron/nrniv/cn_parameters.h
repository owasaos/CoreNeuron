/**
 * \class cn_parameters
 * \brief Parses and contains Command Line parameters for Core Neuron
 *
 * This structure contains all the parameters that CoreNeuron fetches
 * from the Command Line. It uses the CLI11 libraries to parse these parameters
 * and saves them in an internal public structure. Each parameter can be
 * accessed or written freely. By default the constructor instantiates a
 * CLI11 object and initializes it for CoreNeuron use.
 * This object is freely accessible from any point of the program.
 * An ostream method is also provided to print out all the parameters that
 * CLI11 parse.
 * Please keep in mind that, due to the nature of the subcommands in CLI11,
 * the command line parameters for subcategories NEED to be come before the relative
 * parameter. e.g. --mpi --gpu gpu --nwarp
 * Also single dash long options are not supported anymore (-mpi -> --mpi).
